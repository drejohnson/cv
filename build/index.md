I have been doing frontend and backend development since 2010. I began developing in PHP, creating and managing Wordpress based sites. I’m very proficient working in a Linux environment and can configure and mantian Apache and NGINX web servers. Around 2014 I began to primarily use JavaScript for frontend and backend development. I try to utilize the latest tech and best practices for building UI’s in JavaScript using libraries and frameworks like React and Angular. For backend development I utilize Node with Express and GraphQL for fullstack apps.
