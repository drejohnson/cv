      "I am a technology enthusiast with a passion for developing for the web. As a fullstack javascript developer, my job is to utilize the latest tech, trends and best practices for building performant apps in javascript. By utilizing React on the frontend, I'm able to construct rich UI's that interface with a backend that consist of Node.js and GraphQL. My interest in static typing has led me to discover ReasonML/Ocaml which allows me to write type-safe code that compiles to javascript and results in less bugs and better maintainability. In the rapidly evolving landscape of the web, I'm constantly on a journey to learn more.",
